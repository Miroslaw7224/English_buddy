Input JSON (from app)
{
  "level": "A2",                   // A1–C2
  "topic": "Travel and directions",
  "focus": ["vocabulary","grammar"], // any of: vocabulary|grammar|listening_stub|reading|mixed
  "items": 8,                      // 4–15
  "constraints": {"timeLimitSec": 240, "randomize": true}

Question types (pick mix appropriate to level)
- MCQ (single/best answer)
- Gap-fill (one word; for C1/C2 allow collocations)
- Sentence transformation (A2+)
- Ordering (A2+: put steps/sentences in order)
- Matching (word ↔ definition/collocation)
- Error-spotting + correction (B1+)
- Micro-writing (B2+: 1–2 sentences, constrained)

Leveling rules (examples)
- A1: concrete vocab, be/have, this/that, can; 6–8 words per sentence.
- A2: past simple/going to, comparatives, frequent collocations.
- B1: narrative tenses, first/second conditional, phrasal verbs (common).
- B2: modals of deduction, passive range, relative/participle clauses.
- C1/C2: register/nuance, idioms, inversion, clefts, concision.
